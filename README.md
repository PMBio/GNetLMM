# GNetLMM

Gene network linear mixed models (GNetLMM) is an eQTL mapping method that increases the power to detect _trans_ eQTLs.
Our approach learns local directed gene-regulatory networks to condition on the expression levels of selected genes, thereby accounting for confounding and regulatory context.

The implementation is in Python and builds on the [mtSet](https://github.com/PMBio/mtSet) toolbox and the linear mixed model library [LIMIX](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/limix).
